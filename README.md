# kmt

A software to create webpages dynamically, and serve them statically.

This is an ongoing project to achieve this [VISION](VISION.md). And Here are some [resources and references of old plans and others' projects](res-refs.md).

_note_: Kmt is named after my country Egypt. Egypt is called Kmt in the ancient egyptian language.
